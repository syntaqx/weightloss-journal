> __Note__: I'm still on my journey, so I'll post more as I hit my goal(s). Follow along for more information!

## November 2022

Likely due to Thanksgiving, or general holiday shenanigans and laziness, I weighed myself at my highest ever weight: 220.

This caused a cascade of body dismorphia, self-reflection, and mostly just made me realize changes were needed. In high
school, I played plenty of sports, and weighed the 165-175 range, with fairly low body fat/lean muscle. I've worked in
tech since 2004, so I spend 6-12 hours a day in front of a computer, which over time has contributed to my body having
more fat, less muslce, and probably lots of other sad things. Becoming active needs to happen.

## November-December 2022

From November-December I attempted to implement intermittent fasting by allowing myself to eat anywhere from 12pm - 8pm.

Although I did end up losing close to 10lbs, this was an overall failure in execution. My lifestyle has always had me up at all
sorts of hours for work, or being out with friends. Drinking at night when I was out always invalidated my fast, or I ended up
ruining what would be a good time with them; I did see some significant weight loss, but it wasn't working the way that it should,
and I always felt guilt regarding the fast rather than feeling like I was making progression.

I started doing research with the following goals in mind:

- [ ] I want to reach 175 lbs and significantly lower my body fat %
  - The poundage isn't as important as the changes to myself physically, but that was what I used to weigh.
- [ ] I wanted to be able to drink alchohol still. My friends and I love going to karaoke and things throughout the week, so it had to be compatible with my lifestyle
- [ ] I wanted to be able to eat as my schedule allowed me to; My day-to-day is chaotic.
- [ ] I smoke: cigarettes and vaping - While I want to eventually quit this too, I'm keeping focused on one problem at a time for sanity.
- [ ] I know that sleep is important, but my work and social schedule doesn't allow me to keep a consistent sleep schedule; one problem at a time.
- [ ] Everywhere else I could, I'd make a reasonable effort to stay within a diet/budget

## December 27th, 2022

- __Todays Weight__: 210 lbs

Over the prior weeks, I was doing a lot of research regarding apps that I might use to help with my Intermittent Fasting, or
general solutions to help me keep my goals in line, and I essentially came down to two weight-loss facts that were important:

- Intermittent Fasting is good, but not required
- Operating in a caloric deficet was pretty much the only thing that mattered for weight loss

And wound up finding an app that would help me with both: [Lose It!](https://www.loseit.com/)

I started daily entries in this app, with a personal goal of always entering the closest information possible, and staying under
the caloric budget provided. This essentially meant that I could do whatever I wanted, alchohol or not, as long as I stayed within
budget.

I started tracking calories that day.

## January 2023

- __Starting Weight__: 209.9 lbs
- __Ending Weight__: 197.8 lbs

I consistently entered in all of my calories daily; Usually rolling over calories from the day before if I went over. To
aid in my weight loss goals, I also started researching various diets that would potentially be useful, and came to a few
understandings, and set my goals as follows:

### Program:

- __Goal Weight__: 175lbs
- __Weekly Weight Loss__: 2 lbs
- __Activity Level__: Somewhat active
- __Adjustment__: None
- __Standard Budget:__ 1,678 calories per day
- __Nutrition Strategy__: High Protein Strategy (131g Protein, 24g Fiber)

With an additional soft goal of:

- __Intermittent Fasting:__ 12h - Every Day

> I don't expect I'll do well on this still, but I'll try for it when I can.

This program seem to hit all of my requirements, so I'm committing to it.

Additionally to help in acheiving and tracking my goals, I ordered:

- [Enerbone 32oz Water Bottle](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B09W981XT2/)
  - I found that with a slightly larger bottle, I was able to drink my 64oz of water a day easier than having to refill smaller ones that I already had; But too big and I wouldn't carry it around. This also fit in my cars cup holder.
- [Fitbit Versa 4](https://www.fitbit.com/global/us/products/smartwatches/versa4)
  - Set my daily step goal to 8500, which was pretty high for my sedentary life style.
- [Fitbit Aria Air](https://www.fitbit.com/global/us/products/scales/aria-air?sku=203BK)
  - Sounded pretty cool that it would enter my weight in the app automatically when I stepped on it.
- Protein Supplement:
  - [Soylent Chocolate High Protein Nutrition Shake](https://soylent.com/products/soylent-complete-protein-chocolate)
  - [Optimum Nutrition Gold Standard Protein Shake, Chocolate](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B09V1S9168/)
  - [Quest Nutrition Oatmeal Chocolate Chip Protein Bar](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01IRE8IQ8/)
  - [think! Protein Bars - Chunky Peanut Butter](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000CRHQN0/)
- **Daily Supplements:**
  - [One A Day Men's Multivitamin](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001F71XAI/)
  - [Zero for Him Dietary Fiber Supplement](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B074DPWKJV/)
  - [Nature Made Fish Oil Minis](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B09SRB8BXP/)

### Updates on the tech choices

- The Fitbit Versa 4 does not seem to work on my non-dominant arm because of my tattoo. Works fine on my dominant arm.
- The Fitbit Area Air weight sync feature is pretty awful, and only works maybe 40% of the time - I manually enter a lot of the weights. Would not recommend.
- Soylent is delicious and has lots of good vitamins and shit too, but I still have trouble hitting my protein goals, especially on days that I want to drink.
  I eventually should do some meal prep for the week, but I haven't been able to trick myself into enjoying it yet. I like food diversity a **LOT**.
- The Quest Oatmeal Chocolate Chip Bars taste awful
- The think! bars are significantly better, but have much less protein in them.

I've also been pretty bad with taking my supplements every day, but I do my best.

## February 2023

- __Starting Weight__: 196.8 lbs
- __Ending Weight__: 189.4 lbs

Nothing of real note happened in February. My weight loss is going well, and I've mostly kept within my calory budget by week,
not always by day. Still carrying calories over for nights that I go out drinking, and subtracting it from the calories I can have
the next day (by adding something as an Early Snack called `Calories 500` or whatever my overage was)

## March 2023

- __Starting Weight__: 191.2 lbs
- __Ending Weight__: 189.2 lbs

### March 12, 2023

- __Todays Weight:__ 191.2 lbs

I've hit a weird plateau in my weight loss around 190lbs. To help in this, I've started a membership with [EōS Fitness](https://eosfitness.com/).
I purchased a Black Membership (their highest level) so I could bring a friend with me every Sunday, with a soft goal
of:

- __Sunday__: Upper Body; 1-3 Miles Cardio (1-2 hours total)
- __Monday__: Lower Body; 1-3 Miles Cardio (1-2 hours total)
- __Tuesday__: Back/Core; 1-3 Miles Cardio (1-2 hours total)

> __Note__: I both hate, and can't jog/run for longer periods of time (likely because I'm a smoker). My goal is the steps
> and 5 miles/day that FitBit recommends I get. I seem to be able to hit that with my 1-3 mile range and average the other
> 2 from daily activities.

> The workouts per day can optionally be swapped around, just making sure I target all areas of the body throughout the 3
days that I go, and a stretch goal of 4 days a week.

I've opted to not using a personal trainer, because I'm not convinced they add any value than me just going to the gym
until I've made the effort to go consistently myself and use the machines.

Additionally, I wanted to make sure that I wasn't losing any muscle weight (and hopefully building some). Although it's
always been in my weight loss app, I've started to make specific effort to make sure days that I'm at the gym I'm getting
sufficient protein (Fiber has been a challenge even with the supplements, but that too) - So more protein drinks. Still
considering Whey Powder but haven't found anything that doesn't sound disgusting.

Because I basically owned 1 set of gym clothes, I also bought a few sets of various Joggers/Running Pants, a few workout
tank tops (all of which I've not liked), and Compression Pants/Capris off Amazon.

I also picked up some preworkout at EoS - It's awful tasting so I won't recommend it. I plan to use this on days that I'm at
the gym before 6pm. I also picked up a few other useful things:

- [BlenderBottle Classic Shaker Bottle](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01LZ2UP91/) - The lid doesn't seal without significant force after I washed it in the dishwasher, I'll probably buy another one from another brand.
- [Compression Running Socks](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07WVPQ1SK/) - I'm tired of having to use my day socks for Gym things.

### March 21, 2023

- __Todays Weight__: 191.0 lbs

I use TikTok a lot for general happiness, but also started following a lot of influencers for gym, weight loss, etc. The
most significant of which has been Papa Swolio - I get a daily reminder on my news feed to "Go to the fucking gym" - Which
has been weirdly useful, and gets me off the couch at to the gym. I don't go every day, as he recommends, but it does get
me out more than I thought I could. I ordered a few of his tanks in various colors/qualities, all of which I've liked:

- [Go To The F*cking Gym Men's Premium Tank Top](https://papaswolio.com/products/go-to-the-f-cking-gym-men-s-premium-tank-top-1)
- [Go To The F*cking Gym Premium Tank Top](https://papaswolio.com/products/go-to-the-f-cking-gym-premium-tank-top-1?variant=39620743430240)
- [Go To The F*cking Gym Tank Top](https://papaswolio.com/products/go-to-the-f-cking-gym-tank-top-3)

## April 2023

- __Starting Weight__: 189.0 lbs
- __Ending Weight__: TBD

### April 2nd 2023

We played our first game of golf today, and I also used a cart. _With_ the cart, I got my full 10,000 steps in and almost
5 miles of walking. I've purchased a golf push cart, and next time we go I will be walking the course (we play 9 holes).
This will stub in for cardio on Sundays. Gym was exhausting today as a side effect, so I only walked 1 mile on the treadmill.

### April 3rd, 2023

- __Todays Weight__: 188.4 lbs

I'm still weirdly plateaud between 186-190lbs, although I'm actually starting to notice changes with my fat distribution and
some muscular definition showing. Still a lot more stomache fat than I wish, but I also can start to see my upper abs ever
so slightly, so I'm hoping that I'm just losing fat, and gaining some early-gains muslce.

#### Notes

- I finished my Optimum Gold Standard Protein Shake's today. Honestly they were pretty awful compared to Soylent, so I won't
  be ordering them again. Might try some additional ones though, or even just get a Whey Protein powder... trying to find good
  ones right now that are flavorless.
- While my week-to-week has been okay, I've certainly been drinking a lot more the last little bit due to stressful things in my
  personal life. Cutting back on this while maintaining my daily caloric budget and gym goals through the week might be what gets
  me past the 185 mark.
- The gym bag I've been using has sucked, and a lot of "nice" ones seem stupid expensive. I found one that is relatively affordable
  that I ordered, hopefully it's good.
  - [SOAEON Small Fitness Workout Sports Duffle Bag with Wet Pocket & Shoes Compartment](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B099RNQTBQ)
- Saw these in a low-calorie/high-protein recipe on TikTok and ordered them
  - [Walden Farms Ranch Dressing](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01HUC6E9Q/)
  - [Walden Farms Chipotle Ranch Dressing](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B008230BCE/)
- I wasn't able to hit my cardio that I wanted at the gym today becacuse it won't stop freaking snowing and I didn't wear my gym
  shoes so my feet wouldn't be soaked. I walked half a mile though.

> __Note__: Today is the day I started this journal.

### April 4th 2023

- __Todays Weight__: TBD

Monday-Sunday Goal:

- Let's see if we can all-time-low weigh at 185 lbs, currently the ATL is 186.6 lbs
- Hit daily protein, fiber and caloric deficit goals every day this week (without any carry over days)
- 64oz of water every day, at minimum
- No alchohol this week, which is a bummer, but it's not doing me any favors. I'll make up for it next week.

Considering buying cross trainer shoes, as my current running shoes are starting to hurt my feet. Most options on Amazon
look like $50-$70, all the way up to like $150 for anything with good reviews; may just stop into a local shop and pick
some up though so I can be sure they fit well, and have them for todays workout.
