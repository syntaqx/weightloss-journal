# Journal Entries

## November 2022

Likely due to Thanksgiving, or general holiday shenanigans and laziness, I weighed myself at my highest ever weight: 220.

This caused a cascade of body dismorphia, self-reflection, and mostly just made me realize changes were needed. In high
school, I played plenty of sports, and weighed the 165-175 range, with fairly low body fat/lean muscle. I've worked in
tech since 2004, so I spend 6-12 hours a day in front of a computer, which over time has contributed to my body having
more fat, less muscle, and probably lots of other sad things. Becoming active needs to happen.

## November-December 2022

From November-December I attempted to implement intermittent fasting by allowing myself to eat anywhere from 12pm - 8pm.

Although I did end up losing close to 10lbs, this was an overall failure in execution. My lifestyle has always had me up at all
sorts of hours for work, or being out with friends. Drinking at night when I was out always invalidated my fast, or I ended up
ruining what would be a good time with them; I did see some significant weight loss, but it wasn't working the way that it should,
and I always felt guilt regarding the fast rather than feeling like I was making progression.

I started doing research with the following goals in mind:

- [ ] I want to reach 175 lbs and significantly lower my body fat %
  - The poundage isn't as important as the changes to myself physically, but that was what I used to weigh.
- [ ] I wanted to be able to drink alchohol still. My friends and I love going to karaoke and things throughout the week, so it had to be compatible with my lifestyle
- [ ] I wanted to be able to eat as my schedule allowed me to; My day-to-day is chaotic.
- [ ] I smoke: cigarettes and vaping - While I want to eventually quit this too, I'm keeping focused on one problem at a time for sanity.
- [ ] I know that sleep is important, but my work and social schedule doesn't allow me to keep a consistent sleep schedule; one problem at a time.
- [ ] Everywhere else I could, I'd make a reasonable effort to stay within a diet/budget

## December 27th, 2022

- __Todays Weight__: 210 lbs

Over the prior weeks, I was doing a lot of research regarding apps that I might use to help with my Intermittent Fasting, or
general solutions to help me keep my goals in line, and I essentially came down to two weight-loss facts that were important:

- Intermittent Fasting is good, but not required
- Operating in a caloric deficet was pretty much the only thing that mattered for weight loss

And wound up finding an app that would help me with both: [Lose It!](https://www.loseit.com/)

I started daily entries in this app, with a personal goal of always entering the closest information possible, and staying under
the caloric budget provided. This essentially meant that I could do whatever I wanted, alchohol or not, as long as I stayed within
budget.

I started tracking calories that day.

## January 2023

- __Starting Weight__: 209.9 lbs
- __Ending Weight__: 197.8 lbs

I consistently entered in all of my calories daily; Usually rolling over calories from the day before if I went over. To
aid in my weight loss goals, I also started researching various diets that would potentially be useful, and came to a few
understandings, and set my goals as follows:

### Program:

- __Goal Weight__: 175lbs
- __Weekly Weight Loss__: 2 lbs
- __Activity Level__: Somewhat active
- __Adjustment__: None
- __Standard Budget:__ 1,678 calories per day
- __Nutrition Strategy__: High Protein Strategy (131g Protein, 24g Fiber)

With an additional soft goal of:

- __Intermittent Fasting:__ 12h - Every Day

> I don't expect I'll do well on this still, but I'll try for it when I can.

This program seem to hit all of my requirements, so I'm committing to it.

Additionally to help in acheiving and tracking my goals, I ordered:

- [Enerbone 32oz Water Bottle](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B09W981XT2/)
  - I found that with a slightly larger bottle, I was able to drink my 64oz of water a day easier than having to refill smaller ones that I already had; But too big and I wouldn't carry it around. This also fit in my cars cup holder.
- [Fitbit Versa 4](https://www.fitbit.com/global/us/products/smartwatches/versa4)
  - Set my daily step goal to 8500, which was pretty high for my sedentary life style.
- [Fitbit Aria Air](https://www.fitbit.com/global/us/products/scales/aria-air?sku=203BK)
  - Sounded pretty cool that it would enter my weight in the app automatically when I stepped on it.
- Protein Supplement:
  - [Soylent Chocolate High Protein Nutrition Shake](https://soylent.com/products/soylent-complete-protein-chocolate)
  - [Optimum Nutrition Gold Standard Protein Shake, Chocolate](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B09V1S9168/)
  - [Quest Nutrition Oatmeal Chocolate Chip Protein Bar](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01IRE8IQ8/)
  - [think! Protein Bars - Chunky Peanut Butter](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000CRHQN0/)
- **Daily Supplements:**
  - [One A Day Men's Multivitamin](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001F71XAI/)
  - [Zero for Him Dietary Fiber Supplement](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B074DPWKJV/)
  - [Nature Made Fish Oil Minis](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B09SRB8BXP/)

### Updates on the tech choices

- The Fitbit Versa 4 does not seem to work on my non-dominant arm because of my tattoo. Works fine on my dominant arm.
- The Fitbit Area Air weight sync feature is pretty awful, and only works maybe 40% of the time - I manually enter a lot of the weights. Would not recommend.
- Soylent is delicious and has lots of good vitamins and shit too, but I still have trouble hitting my protein goals, especially on days that I want to drink.
  I eventually should do some meal prep for the week, but I haven't been able to trick myself into enjoying it yet. I like food diversity a **LOT**.
- The Quest Oatmeal Chocolate Chip Bars taste awful
- The think! bars are significantly better, but have much less protein in them.

I've also been pretty bad with taking my supplements every day, but I do my best.

## February 2023

- __Starting Weight__: 196.8 lbs
- __Ending Weight__: 189.4 lbs

Nothing of real note happened in February. My weight loss is going well, and I've mostly kept within my calory budget by week,
not always by day. Still carrying calories over for nights that I go out drinking, and subtracting it from the calories I can have
the next day (by adding something as an Early Snack called `Calories 500` or whatever my overage was)

## March 2023

- __Starting Weight__: 191.2 lbs
- __Ending Weight__: 189.2 lbs

### March 12, 2023

- __Todays Weight:__ 191.2 lbs

I've hit a weird plateau in my weight loss around 190lbs. To help in this, I've started a membership with [EōS Fitness](https://eosfitness.com/).
I purchased a Black Membership (their highest level) so I could bring a friend with me every Sunday, with a soft goal
of:

- __Sunday__: Upper Body; 1-3 Miles Cardio (1-2 hours total)
- __Monday__: Lower Body; 1-3 Miles Cardio (1-2 hours total)
- __Tuesday__: Back/Core; 1-3 Miles Cardio (1-2 hours total)

> __Note__: I both hate, and can't jog/run for longer periods of time (likely because I'm a smoker). My goal is the steps
> and 5 miles/day that FitBit recommends I get. I seem to be able to hit that with my 1-3 mile range and average the other
> 2 from daily activities.

> The workouts per day can optionally be swapped around, just making sure I target all areas of the body throughout the 3
days that I go, and a stretch goal of 4 days a week.

I've opted to not using a personal trainer, because I'm not convinced they add any value than me just going to the gym
until I've made the effort to go consistently myself and use the machines.

Additionally, I wanted to make sure that I wasn't losing any muscle weight (and hopefully building some). Although it's
always been in my weight loss app, I've started to make specific effort to make sure days that I'm at the gym I'm getting
sufficient protein (Fiber has been a challenge even with the supplements, but that too) - So more protein drinks. Still
considering Whey Powder but haven't found anything that doesn't sound disgusting.

Because I basically owned 1 set of gym clothes, I also bought a few sets of various Joggers/Running Pants, a few workout
tank tops (all of which I've not liked), and Compression Pants/Capris off Amazon.

I also picked up some preworkout at EoS - It's awful tasting so I won't recommend it. I plan to use this on days that I'm at
the gym before 6pm. I also picked up a few other useful things:

- [BlenderBottle Classic Shaker Bottle](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01LZ2UP91/) - The lid doesn't seal without significant force after I washed it in the dishwasher, I'll probably buy another one from another brand.
- [Compression Running Socks](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07WVPQ1SK/) - I'm tired of having to use my day socks for Gym things.

### March 21, 2023

- __Todays Weight__: 191.0 lbs

I use TikTok a lot for general happiness, but also started following a lot of influencers for gym, weight loss, etc. The
most significant of which has been Papa Swolio - I get a daily reminder on my news feed to "Go to the fucking gym" - Which
has been weirdly useful, and gets me off the couch at to the gym. I don't go every day, as he recommends, but it does get
me out more than I thought I could. I ordered a few of his tanks in various colors/qualities, all of which I've liked:

- [Go To The F*cking Gym Men's Premium Tank Top](https://papaswolio.com/products/go-to-the-f-cking-gym-men-s-premium-tank-top-1)
- [Go To The F*cking Gym Premium Tank Top](https://papaswolio.com/products/go-to-the-f-cking-gym-premium-tank-top-1?variant=39620743430240)
- [Go To The F*cking Gym Tank Top](https://papaswolio.com/products/go-to-the-f-cking-gym-tank-top-3)

## April 2023

- __Starting Weight__: 189.0 lbs
- __Ending Weight__: TBD

### April 2nd 2023

We played our first game of golf today, and I also used a cart. _With_ the cart, I got my full 10,000 steps in and almost
5 miles of walking. I've purchased a golf push cart, and next time we go I will be walking the course (we play 9 holes).
This will stub in for cardio on Sundays. Gym was exhausting today as a side effect, so I only walked 1 mile on the treadmill.

### April 3rd, 2023

- __Todays Weight__: 188.4 lbs

I'm still weirdly plateaud between 186-190lbs, although I'm actually starting to notice changes with my fat distribution and
some muscular definition showing. Still a lot more stomache fat than I wish, but I also can start to see my upper abs ever
so slightly, so I'm hoping that I'm just losing fat, and gaining some early-gains muslce.

#### Notes

- I finished my Optimum Gold Standard Protein Shake's today. Honestly they were pretty awful compared to Soylent, so I won't
  be ordering them again. Might try some additional ones though, or even just get a Whey Protein powder... trying to find good
  ones right now that are flavorless.
- While my week-to-week has been okay, I've certainly been drinking a lot more the last little bit due to stressful things in my
  personal life. Cutting back on this while maintaining my daily caloric budget and gym goals through the week might be what gets
  me past the 185 mark.
- The gym bag I've been using has sucked, and a lot of "nice" ones seem stupid expensive. I found one that is relatively affordable
  that I ordered, hopefully it's good.
  - [SOAEON Small Fitness Workout Sports Duffle Bag with Wet Pocket & Shoes Compartment](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B099RNQTBQ)
- Saw these in a low-calorie/high-protein recipe on TikTok and ordered them
  - [Walden Farms Ranch Dressing](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01HUC6E9Q/)
  - [Walden Farms Chipotle Ranch Dressing](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B008230BCE/)
- I wasn't able to hit my cardio that I wanted at the gym today becacuse it won't stop freaking snowing and I didn't wear my gym
  shoes so my feet wouldn't be soaked. I walked half a mile though.

> __Note__: Today is the day I started this journal.

### April 4th 2023

- __Todays Weight__: 186.2

Monday-Sunday Goal:

- Let's see if we can get an ATL (all-time-low) of 185, todays weigh in was the lowest so far.
- Hit daily protein, fiber and caloric deficit goals every day this week (without any carry over days)
- 64oz of water every day, at minimum
- No alchohol this week, which is a bummer, but it's not doing me any favors. I'll make up for it next week.

Considering buying cross trainer shoes, as my current running shoes are starting to hurt my feet. Most options on Amazon
look like $50-$70, all the way up to like $150 for anything with good reviews; may just stop into a local shop and pick
some up though so I can be sure they fit well, and have them for todays workout.

### April 5th 2023

- __Todays Weight__: 186.8

Last night while I was on the treadmill trying to get my 10k steps and 5 miles for the day covered, I was listening to some videos
covering articles regarding protein, given that I wanted to buy some protein powder to hopefully make it significantly easier for
me to acheive my protein goals (it's been a struggle). Some of the information I found out is:

- 50% of Americans aren't even hitting their minimum protein goal
- Not all protein is treated equal, so 30g of protein isn't necessarily 30g of protein
  - We absorb and utilize certain proteins better than others
  - There's a scoring system called DIAAS (Digestible Indispensable Amino Acid Score) (recognized by the FAO) that tells you the "quality" of a protein
  - The quality is measured by digestability and essential amino acids

#### DIAAS%

<details>
    <summary>High Quality Proteins</summary>

- 114 - Cows Milk
- 113 - Boiled Eggs
- 111 - Beef
- 108 - Chicken Breast
  
</details>

<details>
    <summary>Good Quality Proteins</summary>

- 92 - Soy Protein
- 92 - Pea Protein
- 84 - Baked Chickpeas
  
</details>

<details>
    <summary>Poor Quality Proteins</summary>

- 59 - Rice
- 54 - Lentils
- 47 - Wheat Bread?
- 43 - Peanuts
- 40 - Almonds
- 29 - Bread
</details>

People often just assume 18 grams of protein from chicken is the same as 18
grams of protein from lentils or a peanut butter sandwich or some eggs.

Now, here’s something you might find surprising. 50 grams of protein per day is
the minimum protein requirement for adults*, and if you look here, most of these
103 countries get most of their protein from plants and they’re hitting their
50grams a day just fine. But plant proteins aren’t digested as well, so if you
incorporate the digestibility of the proteins, far more countries are just under the
50g requirement. Now, if you account for the fact that many plant proteins don’t
provide enough of one or more of the essential amino acids and therefore that
protein can’t be fully utilized, then it turns out that none of these 103 countries
are hitting the 50g protein requirement.[9]

*In fact, the RDA is for high quality protein.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6037730/230249372-fb68b192-7ff4-4797-90d9-919c3761ba80.png)

> Population protein intakes and food sustainability indices: [The metrics matter](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S2211912421000572?via%3Dihub)

Now these countries could certainly hit the 50 grams of utilizable protein by
simply eating a lot more plant protein. In developed countries we simply eat a
bunch of protein in total so this is less of an issue.

But, research suggests that protein quality may still matter.

> Read the full transcript [here](protein-is-not-protein.pdf)

#### So what am I doing about it?

This above transcript, as well as additional information that the biggest thing that mattered for gaining muscle was simply just going
to the gym, and (if I remember correctly) only ~17% additional gains would even be made by adding protein. So, me sticking to the 131g
of protein by day would likely be sufficient, when applying a few goals:

1. Try to focus on high quality proteins to keep digestability high, and allowing me to get essential amino acids without much effort - This means Whey Isolate for me (highest protein concentration, fewest calories).
2. Soylent is a Soy protein, which while still good, means I should buy a Whey protein to supplement when I'm not using Soylent.
3. I should eat a lot more eggs, because they're pretty easy to just boil and throw back.

So I ended up buying [Isopure Protein Powder - Unflavored](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00SCO8AA8/) from Walmart (link is to Amazon).
In hopes that I could just add it to a glass of 2% milk and call it a day. This was a mistake. While I think Unflavored protein
will go great in things like smoothies or other foods, the blandness of Whey overpowered the taste of milk.. man was it rough
to choke the glass down. I will likely be picking up some Chocolate Whey Protein at Gym tonight (going additional times this week
so I can hopefully hit my 185 goal), as Chocolate Milk seems significantly easier to drink than the monstrocity I just tasted.

### April 6th 2023

- __Todays Weight:__ 186.8

Going to start weighing myself under the following criteria to try and get consistent results:

- I've completed _at least_ a 12 hour fast
- I've slept within that fast
  - Which implies I wasn't drinking much water for the last 6 hours
- I've gone to the restroom, and weigh myself prior to eating that day
- This usually means I'm weighing myself in the mornings-noon

Additionally, while at the gym yesterday I did a bunch of research on YouTube regarding Whey Protein quality, reviews and such, and
essentially came down to a few important characteristics that I wanted from my protein powder:

- Whey Protein Isolate > Whey Protein Concentrate
  - Isolate goes under more processing, which results in higher protein content with less carbs, lactose and fat
- Most Whey Proteins use a combination of Isolate __and__ Concentrate, often prioritizing Concentrate as it's cheaper
- Isopure seems to be rated well online (although I'm sure these "top 10 protein" boards are fairly biased)
- Isopure _does not_ use Concentrate, although does say it contains Soy; Going to stay with Isopure for now.

Purchased a few things:

- [Isopure Protein Powder - Dark Chocolate](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07PHHKV6X) - Time to attempt 2% Milk + Chocolate for better flavor, I'll follow up after I've tried it
- [NonEcho Men Sauna Vest](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01767LOYU) - This should be really nice for the Sauna at EoS; Have been doing research that Sauna a few times a week is both good for health, and it's free calories burnt
- [MEETWOO Mens Compression Pants](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B09N8Z11YQ/) - I never seem to have enough because I'm lazy and barely do laundry

I've unfortunately got a blister on my right foot (2nd smallest toe) which makes it pretty impossible for me to do cardio without aggrevating it.
Potentially not going to the gym today, or if I do, just going to use the new sauna vest to compensate. Plus a little rest for the body is likely
good as this is the most I've gone to gym in a week, and my body isn't used to the stress of it.

### April 7th 2023

- __Todays Weight:__ 186.2 lbs (UGH SO CLOSE TO 185!)

The Isopure Dark Chocolate with Milk is awesome and 38.5g of protein for 400ml (1 scoop + 2% milk).

I got a tattoo on my shoulder today, so no gym possibilities, which is probably pretty good given that my body could use a rest (my lower legs are starting to hurt from cardio).

Going to attempt to hit my protein goal with minimal calories today and fingers crossed I break the 185.X number tomorrow morning. Probably going to go for an even longer fast
just to help send it.

### April 10th 2023

- __Todays Weight:__ 185 lbs

Over the weekend I had two weigh-ins for 185.8 and 185.7, so I had a _little_ cheat day by going out for Easter, and then hanging out with my friend for a movie, as well as drank
on Sunday as a celebration. Since I golfed on Sunday, I basically doubled my calories for the day so I only ended up going about 100 over. I did skip Gym on Sunday as Golf+Activies
ended up netting me 15k steps. Although I technically didn't hit my milestone until today, I'm pretty happy. Back to protein-rich food for the week, and we'll see if I end up going
out much this week.

No specific weight goals for this week, just hoping to stay with the caloric deficit and see if it gives me my 1-2 lbs loss for the week, as I think I pushed it pretty hard this week.
Going to try for a 2 days on, 1 day later in the week system as my Wednesday is pretty busy.

## April 17th 2023

- __Todays Weight:__ 185.2 lbs

Had a really rough work week, so I took the weekend off of tracking my calories for 3 days. Had some drinks, had some good food, and took the time for myself. This certainly pushed
a little bit of my progress back, but nothing that's terribly concerning, and just means I need to be back on track this week to hopefully push towards 183. Additionally, learned a couple
things that is really useful that I'll start implementing:

- The most common dossage of whey protein is 25-50 grams/day (1-2 scoops, depending on what brand)
- There's _some_ studies that say over consuming whey protein can be pretty bad
- Ideally, you should be getting protein from a variety of sources anyways

So, the short version here, is I will be likely taking at least 1, usually 2 scoops of protein a day maximum and then finding the rest of it from other sources.

Also as a side note, a lot of sources are saying to avoid using milk as it's a good amount of sugar. Some better combinations are:

- Water
- Unsweetened Nut Milks

However, I don't think I'm going to follow this. Milk is tasty, and I still fall into my caloric deficit, so for now I'm going to keep making my chocolate milk.

## April 21st, 2023

- __Todays Weight:__ 183 lbs

This week has been extremely productive with hitting my protein goals (now using the Isopure Chocolate & Milk, 2 scoops/day).
I've additionally added apples as a good source of Fiber to my diet. Since I've been hitting my macro goals significantly
easier this way, I've been able to have a few drinks when I'm out with my friends without making breaking my calorie ceiling.

Still been hitting the gym 2-4 times a week, which has been awesome. Excited to see where 175 looks like with the minor
changes I'm seeing in my physique, and if I'm able to burn off that stubborn belly fat.

I did end up buying some more Joggers/Sweatpants for the gym, as I don't do laundry enough for the few that I had. Also
had to buy the larger container of Isopure protein as I'm just about through my bag.

Had a fun chat today with a friend that was talking about cardio and its role in weightloss, and forgot that I found
some information that I never posted on here, that figured was worth adding.

Basically, when you think about losing weight, there's a few things to keep in mind:

### Calories Out - Where does it come from:

- __Resting Metabolic Rate (RMR)__: Calories we burn at reste, that are required for basic life functions
- __Non-Excercise Activity Thermogenesis (NEAT)__: Calories we burn through non-voluntary movement - blinking, figeting, etc.
- __Thermic Effect of Food (TEF)__: Calories we burn by digesting/absorbing the food we eat
- __Physical Activity__: Calories we burn during excercise

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6037730/233696995-b23b4594-e040-430d-9f65-84167a8b885d.png)

Basically the big takeaway from all of this, is that while excercise is still crucial for total caloric burn, a
significant amount of calorie burn does come from RMR, NEAT and TEF. However, you can always add more calories to
both your diet or your deficet by adding weight training and cardio.

While at the gym, generally speaking weight training is significantly higher calorie burn than cardio. They both
have value though, as whatever you enjoy, is what you're going to stick with.

You can always change the percentage of calories burned during excercise by having more excercise. There are some
diminishing effects against your NEAT where your body will attempt to equalize out, but more excercise always
means _at least_ the same, if not more calories are being burned; All while building muscle. When you're in a
caloric deficet, your body will pull energy from both muscles at fat. The biggest goal when losing weight is to
only lose fat, not muscle, which allow you the benefit of looking good after you've lost the fat.

Additionally, cardiovascular excercise, such as running or cycling, can improve heart health, lower blood pressure,
and reduce the risk of chronic diseases such as heart disease. So, while cardio may not be the most efficient way
to burn calories for weight loss, it is still an important component of a healthy lifestyle.

A few facts I pull from this:
- Go to the gym; Prioritize weight lifting over cardio
- You still need cardio, it's good for your heart
- Stay in a caloric deficet, without it you're not going to lose weight (you can't gym your way out of a bad diet)
