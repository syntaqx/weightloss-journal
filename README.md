## November 2022

In November of 2022 (likely because of Thanksgiving & general holiday shenanigans) I weighed myself at my highest weight ever, 220.
This caused a cascade of self-reflection, and body dismorphia that made me realize changes were needed.

In high-school, I played plenty of sports, and weighed the 165-175 range, with fairly low body fat/lean muscle.

I've worked in Tech since 2004, so I spend 6-12 hours a day in front of a computer, which over time has contributed to my body
having more fat, less muslce, and probably lots of other sad things. Becoming active needs to happen.

## November-December 2022

From November-December I attempted to implement intermittent fasting by allowing myself to eat anywhere from 12pm - 8pm.

Although I did end up losing close to 10lbs, this was an overall failure in execution. My lifestyle has always had me up at all
sorts of hours for work, or being out with friends. Drinking at night when I was out always invalidated my fast, or I ended up
ruining what would be a good time with them; I did see some significant weight loss, but it wasn't working the way that it should,
and I always felt guilt regarding the fast rather than feeling like I was making progression.

I started doing research with the following goals in mind:

- [ ] I want to reach 175 lbs and significantly lower my body fat %
  - The poundage isn't as important as the changes to myself physically, but that was what I used to weigh.
- [ ] I wanted to be able to drink alchohol still. My friends and I love going to karaoke and things throughout the week, so it had to be compatible with my lifestyle
- [ ] I wanted to be able to eat as my schedule allowed me to; My day-to-day is chaotic.
- [ ] I smoke: cigarettes and vaping - While I want to eventually quit this too, I'm keeping focused on one problem at a time for sanity.
- [ ] Everywhere else I could, I'd make a reasonable effort to stay within a diet/budget

## December 27th, 2022

- __Weight__: 210 lbs

Over the prior weeks, I was doing a lot of research regarding apps that I might use to help with my Intermittent Fasting, or
general solutions to help me keep my goals in line, and I essentially came down to two weight-loss facts that were important:

- Intermittent Fasting is good, but not required
- Operating in a caloric deficet was pretty much the only thing that mattered for weight loss

And wound up finding an app that would help me with both: [Lose It!](https://www.loseit.com/)

I started daily entries in this app, with a personal goal of always entering the closest information possible, and staying under
the caloric budget provided. This essentially meant that I could do whatever I wanted, alchohol or not, as long as I stayed within
budget.

I started tracking calories that day.

## January 2023

- __Starting Weight__: 209.9 lbs
- __Ending Weight__: 197.8 lbs

I consistently entered in all of my calories daily; Usually rolling over calories from the day before if I went over. To
aid in my weight loss goals, I also started researching various diets that would potentially be useful, and came to a few
understandings, and set my goals as follows:

### Program:

- __Goal Weight__: 175lbs
- __Weekly Weight Loss__: 2 lbs
- __Activity Level__: Somewhat active
- __Adjustment__: None
- __Standard Budget:__ 1,678 calories per day
- __Nutrition Strategy__: High Protein Strategy (131g Protein, 24g Fiber)

With an additional soft goal of:

- __Intermittent Fasting:__ 12h - Every Day

> I don't expect I'll do well on this still, but I'll try for it when I can.

This program seem to hit all of my requirements, so I'm committing to it.

Additionally to help in tracking my goals, I ordered:

- [Fitbit Versa 4](https://www.fitbit.com/global/us/products/smartwatches/versa4)
- [Fitbit Aria Air](https://www.fitbit.com/global/us/products/scales/aria-air?sku=203BK)
- [Soylent Chocolate High Protein Nutrition Shake](https://soylent.com/products/soylent-complete-protein-chocolate)
- [One A Day Men's Multivitamin](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001F71XAI/)
- [Zero for Him Dietary Fiber Supplement](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B074DPWKJV/)
- [Nature Made Fish Oil Minis](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B09SRB8BXP/)

### Updates on the tech choices

- The Fitbit Versa 4 does not seem to work on my non-dominant arm because of my tattoo. Works fine on my dominant arm.
- The Fitbit Area Air sync feature is pretty awful, and only works maybe 40% of the time - I manually enter a lot of the weights
- Soylent is delicious, but I still have trouble hitting my protein goals. Going to try some other brands as well, but honestly
  I need to eventually do meal prep; But haven't been able to trick my brain into liking it yet. I ordered the following:
  - [Optimum Nutrition Gold Standard Protein Shake, Chocolate](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B09V1S9168/)

I've also been pretty bad with taking my supplements every day, but I do my best.

## February 2023

- __Starting Weight__: 196.8 lbs
- __Ending Weight__: 189.4 lbs

## March 2023

- __Starting Weight__: 191.2 lbs
- __Ending Weight__: 189.2 lbs

## March 12, 2023

- __Weight:__ 191.2 lbs

I've hit a weird plateau in my weight loss around 190lbs. To help in this, I've started a membership with E≈çS Fitness.
I purchased a Black Membership (their highest level) so I could bring a friend with me every Sunday, with a soft goal
of:

- __Sunday__: Upper Body; 3 Miles Cardio (1-2 hours total)
- __Monday__: Lower Body; 3 Miles Cardio (1-2 hours total)
- __Tuesday__: Back/Core; 3 Miles Cardio (1-2 hours total)

The workouts per day can optionally be swapped around, just making sure I target all areas of the body throughout the 3
days that I go, and a stretch goal of 4 days a week.

Additionally, I wanted to make sure that I wasn't losing any muscle weight (and hopefully building some). Although it's
always been in my weight loss app, I've started to make specific effort to make sure days that I'm at the gym I'm getting
sufficient protein (Fiber has been a challenge even with the supplements, but that too) - So more protein drinks. Still
considering Whey Powder but haven't found anything that doesn't sound disgusting.

## March 21, 2023

I use TikTok a lot for general happiness, but also started following a lot of influencers for gym, weight loss, etc. The
most significant of which has been Papa Swolio - I get a daily reminder on my news feed to "Go to the fucking gym" - Which
has been weirdly useful, and gets me off the couch at to the gym. I don't go every day, as he recommends, but it does get
me out more than I thought I could. I ordered a few of his tanks, which I like quite a bit.

- [Go To The Fucking Gym Men's Premium Tank Top](https://papaswolio.com/products/go-to-the-f-cking-gym-men-s-premium-tank-top-1)

## April 2023

- __Starting Weight__: 189.0 lbs
- __Ending Weight__: TBD

## April 2nd 2023

We played our first game of golf today, and I also used a cart. _With_ the cart, I got my full 10,000 steps in and almost
5 miles of walking. I've purchased a golf push cart, and next time we go I will be walking the course (we play 9 holes).
This will stub in for cardio on Sundays. Gym was exhausting today as a side effect, so I only walked 1 mile on the treadmill.

## April 3rd, 2023

- __Streak:__ 94 days
- __Lowest Recorded Weight__: 186.6 lbs
- __Todays Weight__: 188.4 lbs

I'm still weirdly plateaud between 186-190lbs, although I'm actually starting to notice changes with my fat distribution and
some muscular definition showing. Still a lot more stomache fat than I wish, but I also can start to see my upper abs ever
so slightly, so I'm hoping that I'm just losing fat, and gaining some early-gains muslce.

### Notes

- I finished my Optimum Gold Standard Protein Shake's today. Honestly they were pretty awful compared to Soylent, so I won't
  be ordering them again. Might try some additional ones though, or even just get a Whey Protein powder... trying to find good
  ones right now that are flavorless.
- While my week-to-week has been okay, I've certainly been drinking a lot more the last little bit due to stressful things in my
  personal life. Cutting back on this while maintaining my daily caloric budget and gym goals through the week might be what gets
  me past the 185 mark.
