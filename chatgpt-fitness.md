Thank you for providing me with this information. Based on what you've shared, here's a custom exercise program that can help you reach your goals:

1. Resistance Training:

Incorporating resistance training into your routine will help you to build lean muscle mass and increase your metabolism. For the elbow popping, you can try adjusting your grip, elbow position, or reducing the weight until the pain subsides. Consult with a physical therapist or trainer to address this issue if it persists.

- Perform 3-4 days of resistance training per week, with 1-2 days of rest between sessions.
- Perform 3-4 sets of each exercise with 8-12 repetitions per set.
- Focus on compound movements that target multiple muscle groups, such as squats, deadlifts, bench press, pull-ups, and rows.
- Incorporate exercises that target your core, such as planks, side planks, and Russian twists.
- Use a weight that is challenging but allows you to complete the reps with good form.
- Track your progress and try to gradually increase the weight or reps as you get stronger.

2. Cardiovascular Training:

- Incorporating cardiovascular training into your routine will help you burn calories and improve your overall fitness.
- Perform cardio exercises 2-3 times a week for at least 20-30 minutes per session.
- Choose exercises that you enjoy such as jogging, cycling, or swimming.
- Try to gradually increase your intensity over time by increasing the speed or resistance.

3. Nutrition:

- Based on the Lose It! app, you should be aiming for a daily calorie deficit of approximately 500-1000 calories to achieve your goal weight. Stick to your caloric deficit but make sure you're not going too low, since it could hinder your progress or cause health issues.
- Consume a balanced diet with plenty of protein to support muscle growth, and fiber to aid digestion and keep you feeling full. Focus on lean protein sources such as chicken breast, turkey, fish, lean beef, and plant-based protein sources like beans, lentils, and tofu. Consume a variety of vegetables and fruits to get enough fiber, vitamins, and minerals.
- Stay hydrated by drinking at least 8-10 cups of water per day.

4. Lifestyle Habits:

- Try to get at least 7-8 hours of sleep each night to help with muscle recovery, reduce stress, and improve overall health.
- Take short breaks during your workday to stand, stretch or move around.
- Stay active throughout the day, by taking walks or doing activities like cleaning, gardening or playing a sport.
- Remember that consistency and patience are key to achieving your fitness goals. Stick to your program, track your progress, and adjust as needed to keep moving forward. Also, if you have any medical conditions or concerns, it's always a good idea to check with a doctor before starting any new exercise program.
